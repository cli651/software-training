* What are we doing today?
- Introduction to C++
 - Functions
 - Headers and includes
 - Namespaces
 - =auto= keyword
 - Working with strings
- Using the RJRobot API
 - Drive in a square
 - Line following

* What is C++?
- Compiled (fast)
- Can be written in many different ways (flexible)
- Not merely "C with classes"

* Starting notes
- We assume some knowledge of basic of C/C++ syntax (if, for, while, datatypes, etc)
 - If you are lost today, there is a catch-up training session which will teach these things. Next Saturday 2-4

* hello-world.cpp
- A simple C++ program, we will be explaining what's going on here and more
- We will be using cpp.sh for live demos
#+BEGIN_SRC C++ -n
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  std::cout << "Hello, world!" << std::endl;
}
#+END_SRC
[[http://cpp.sh/9yupt][Hello World live example]]

* Compiling and Running
- Compiling turns C++ code into an executable program
- g++ is a common C++ compiler
#+BEGIN_SRC
g++ hello-world.cpp -o hello-world.out
./hello-world.out
#+END_SRC

* Functions in C++
- Review: A function is a chunk of code with inputs and outputs
- C++ functions have 0 or more parameters (inputs) and have 0 or 1 output
- Each parameter has a type and there is a return type
- The special function =main()= with return type =int= gets run automatically
- Example
 - Want to add two integers, x and y, and print their result

* Making a Function
1. Informative function name
2. Input types
3. Return type (=void= means no return/output)
#+BEGIN_SRC C++ -n
void addAndPrint(int x, int y) {

}
#+END_SRC

* Making a Function
- Use the parameters to do something
#+BEGIN_SRC C++ -n
void addAndPrint(int x, int y) {
    int sum = x + y;
    std::cout << sum << std::endl;
}
#+END_SRC

* Functions Example
- We can split up this code to show you real return types
- =return= statement must be used since the return type is not =void= anymore
#+BEGIN_SRC C++ -n
void addAndPrint(int x, int y) {
    int sum = x + y;
    std::cout << sum << std::endl;
}

int add(int x, int y) {
    return x + y;
}

void print(int value) {
    std::cout << value << std::endl;
}
#+END_SRC
- =print(add(3, 4))= gives the same result as =addAndPrint(3, 4)=
- [[http://cpp.sh/8skfr][Verify that this indeed works]]

* Forward Declaration
- Declaration = defining the name, parameters, and return type
  - =int foo(int x);=  OR
  - =int foo(int);=
- Definition = declaration + filling in the function
  - =int foo(int x) { return x+1; }=
- If you forward-declare a function, you must do it higher up in the file than the definition
- [[http://cpp.sh/92su4m][Forward Declaration live example]] <- try removing the declaration

* Overloading
- Function signature = name + list of parameter types
- Each function must have a unique signature. Names can be the same as long as the  parameters are different
#+BEGIN_SRC C++ -n
// these all have different signatures
int add(int, int);
int add(int, int, int);
double add(double, double);
double add(double, double, double);
#+END_SRC

* Includes
- Why do we need =#include <iostream>=?
 - [[http://cpp.sh/7jb5t][Many things like std::cout don't exist unless you import them]]
- Includes let you bring other code into a file
- Use this for
 - Standard library functions and data types (anything std::)
 - Other installed libraries (e.g. ROS, OpenCV, Qt)
 - Splitting up a large program into multiple files
- Without including anything, C++ is very limited

* Include syntax
- =<>= gets code from the standard library or installed libraries
- =""= gets code from a nearby folder, or does the same thing as =<>= if it can't find anything
- What's in the =<>= or =""= is a file name
 - Traditionally the file name has extension ".h" or ".hpp"
- Examples:
#+BEGIN_SRC C++ -n
#include <string>  // standard library
#include <QWidget>  // file installed with Qt
#include <ros/ros.h>  // file installed with ROS
#include "include/my_interface.hpp"  // another file in the same project,
                                     // in a folder called "include"
#+END_SRC

* Namespaces
- What happens when two things are assigned the same name (or the same function signature)?
 - [[http://cpp.sh/24v43][You get an error]]
- Solution: protect your variables and function names with a unique namespace
 - [[http://cpp.sh/66mrj][Same program, but with namespaces]]
 - Use keywords from a namespace using the =::= operator
  - types: =std::string=, =my_library::MyClass=
  - functions: =std::min_element=
  - static variables: =std::string::npos=
- Best practice: everything you write that is included should be in a namespace

* "using namespace" keyword
- [[http://cpp.sh/4d5gz][Hello world, but using std namespace]]
- Handy but also defeats the purpose of namespaces
- Use with caution
 - Must be clear, without the namespace, where the function comes from
 - In general, use only one external namespace in a file (usually std)

* "Auto" Keyword
- C++ can figure out for you what type something should be
- Function =MakeObject()= returns some data of a particular type
#+BEGIN_SRC C++
namespace::MyVeryLongDataTypeName data = MakeObject();
#+END_SRC
OR
#+BEGIN_SRC C++
auto data = MakeObject();
#+END_SRC
This can make your code easier or harder to read/maintain, depending on whether you name your variables well

* Strings
- C string (still valid in C++):
#+BEGIN_SRC C++ -n
char[] s = "this is a string";
#+END_SRC
- C++ string:
#+BEGIN_SRC C++ -n
#include <string>
std::string s1("this is a string");  // constructor
std::string s2 = "this is a string";  // same effect as constructor
#+END_SRC
- C++ strings are classes and have methods (like Java, unlike C)

* String Methods
- What methods can I use for a string? (there are lots)
 - [[https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string][Online documentation!]]
 - cppreference.com is a very good resource
- Adding to end:  + and += operators, =append(string)=, =push_back(char)=
 - [[http://cpp.sh/84u76][Adding to string example]]
- Reading user input:  =std::cin >>=
 - [[http://cpp.sh/64mc][Reading user input example]]
- Access characters like an array
 - [[http://cpp.sh/9gb4x][Access chars example]]
- =size()= and =length()= each get number of characters

* Exercise 1
- Find a buddy (or work alone if you want)
- Write a function =make_palindrome=
 - Input: string
 - Output: string with reversed copy attached
 - =make_palindrome("apple")= returns ="appleelppa"=
- Starter code: [[http://cpp.sh/844tx]]

* Solution
- Using what we've learned so far
 - [[http://cpp.sh/92y54]]
- Using Standard Template Library (next week's topic)
 - [[http://cpp.sh/7jmjg]]

* Our Training Robots
- We have robots for you to use!
- Your code runs on your laptop, sending commands via wifi to the robot
- Sensors
  - 2 line
  - 1 color
  - 1 ultrasonic
  - hand proximity / gesture

* RJRobot API
#+BEGIN_SRC C++ -n
RJRobot robot(REAL);  // Make a new robot. Simulation may come later
robot.SetDriveMotors(200, -200);  //-255 to 255 range on motors
robot.SetLiftMotor(127);
robot.Wait(1000ms);
robot.StopMotors();
int line_brightness = robot.GetLineValue(LightSensor::CENTER);  // downwards line sensor
double clearance = robot.GetUltrasonicDistance();  // forwards ultrasonic sensor
Color ball_color = robot.GetColor();  // forwards color sensor. RED, BLUE, or UNKNOWN
#+END_SRC
Full interface defined in [[https://github.com/RoboJackets/stsl/blob/master/include/STSL/RJRobot.h][RJRobot.h]]. Use code completion in CLion as well.

* Connecting to the Robot
- Make sure you have the software-training repo cloned
- Open CLion
- Open the existing project =software-training/hardware_applications=
- In the Build Configuration menu in the top-right of CLion, select the program you want to run (e.g. =spin_in_place=)
- Hit the build button (hammer), make sure everything compiles
- Connect to your robot's wifi network
- Hit the build and run button (green arrow)
- Hit the red square button to stop the robot

* Today's robot challenges
- Drive in a square
  - modify code in =drive_in_square= folder
  - Use a combination of SetDriveMotors, Wait, and StopMotors to drive in a square
  - You should use a for loop
- Line Following
  - Basic algorithm: if black, turn forward-left, else turn forward-right
  - Implement a better way if you want

* Supplemental Challenge 1: "FizzBuzz"
- Print numbers 1 to n, except:
  - If the number is a multiple of 3, print "fizz" instead of the number
  - If the number is a multiple of 5, print "buzz" instead of the number
  - If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, print "fizzbuzz" instead
- Example output (n = 8): =1 2 fizz 4 buzz fizz 7 8=
- Starter code: [[http://cpp.sh/8xuu]]

* Supplemental Challenge 2: Merge Strings
- Given two strings s1 and s2, return the string that has elements of s1 and s2 interweaved
- "abc", "12345" -> "a1b2c345"
- Hint: =<algorithm>= header contains =min= and =max= functions
  - =max(4,7) -> 7=
- Starter code: [[http://cpp.sh/4z5as]]

* Supplemental Challenge Solutions
- FizzBuzz [[http://cpp.sh/7zrsc]]
- Merge Strings [[http://cpp.sh/2h4eg]]
- There are many ways to solve each of these
